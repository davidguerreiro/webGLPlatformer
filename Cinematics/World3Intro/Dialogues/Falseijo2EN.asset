  - That is correct. The blue keys are made of old magic that only exists in this
    world. Nobody makes them, nobody ownes them.
  - Their power lust the evil hearts, that's why you will find powerful enemies around
    them. In the wrong hands, they only give raw power and strenght.
  - A total waste, if may I say.
  - But if you posees a kind and a gentle hearth, the blue keys will bring you whatever
    you wish the most. In your case, to come back home.
