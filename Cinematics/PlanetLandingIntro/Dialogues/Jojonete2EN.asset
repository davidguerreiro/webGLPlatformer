  dialogue:
  - Listen carefully, sir. This world is not listed in any of the Federation space
    maps.
  - From what I can tell, this world is broken, separated into different sections.
    The only way to move through them is by using special doors
  - and portals. You'll have to find the keys that open those doors if you don't
    want to be trapped here for life, sir.
  - I also detect a terrible and dark power... you  must extreme caution, sir.
  - It was a huge pleasure to server alongside you. You must survive. Find a way
    to leave this cursed planet for good.
  - Farewell... my friend.
