  dialogue:
  - You are competent indeed, but a fool.
  - Didn't I tell you that the blue keys would help you to find whatever is most
    precious to you?
  - They have bought you here... to the doors of the castle. My castle.
  - I trusted Scar to defeat you and get the codes to unlock your spaceship. He never
    failed to me before.
