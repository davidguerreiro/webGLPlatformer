  - To give up my power??? Hahahaha
  - I'm completely alone. There is nothing left for me out here. Only destruction
    awaits.
  - I have been 200 years trapped here, 200 years feeding this hatred in order to
    control this power.
  - There is no way you can stop me now.
  - You are about to find how terrorific is the extent of my power.
  - You are going to die!
