  dialogue:
  - I'm going to tell you something.
  - I came to this planet 200 years ago looking for the mystic blue keys. I heard
    a rumour about them and then I moved earth and heaven to find this world.
  - The legend says that the blue keys would help you to get whatver you desire the
    most. I wanted to have the person I loved closed to me again.
  - But when I finally found the blue key... it transformed into a red key. A cursed
    key.
  - It was then when I finally realised that I didn't have a kind heart. I wasn't
    worthy enough.
  - The blue keys rejected me... but I got an inmense power instead. A powerful black
    magic.
